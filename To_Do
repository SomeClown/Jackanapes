 To do list for the command line client
 --------------------------------------

 1. Use tweet_id (or something) to restructure tweet stream to incorporate the history
     with the tweet (replied to, etc.) In other words, show replies inline with the stream
     Make this a selectable option at invokation
 2. Rewrite code for config file using ConfigParser module from standard library
 * Add current functionality to pull oauth keys
 * Add additional functionality for colors, curses-based vs. standard text, etc.
 3. Add database functionality
 * Store friends list (use ID)
 * Store cursor for later recall of where we were in the stream when last ran
 4. Add progress bar for oauth authentication, as well as for possibly large data pulls (friends lists, etc.)
 5. Rewrite portions of code to allow for threading (use standard library's threading module)
 * At least separate keyboard controls into separate thread to allow for mid-stream manipulation of searches, etc.
 6. Add colorization to hashtags both in streams and in static data pulls
 7. Move different functions into separate files as makes sense (argparse and oauth for instance)
 8. Add ability to search and add/remove followers based on different criteria such as: number of tweets, followers, etc.
