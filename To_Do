# To do list for the command line client
# --------------------------------------
#
# (1) Add command for streaming to stream by user (something like PacketQueue -s -u @user
# (2) Add additional color coding to tweets in the stream (yellow for hashtags, etc.)
# (3) Add error-correcting code wrapper around stream to restart when stream crashes
#     (also need to track tweet ID to pull back history for stream restart.)
# (4) Store tweet ID in memory to have a reference for a stream restart if needed
# (5) Add follow command (PacketQueue -f @user)
