(1) Add feature to auto-split long tweets into multiple, shorter tweets.
Take text, ask user if they agree to a split, then split text. Text needs
to have room added to each part to fit "part 1 of 2..." or something like
that. Also need to take any hashtags and copy/paste to each separate part
to maintain tags for continuity

(2) Merge friends/followers/etc. check into one function. Leave functions
separate, but add new functionality. Maybe expose original functions, or
maybe not. Might make private methods in class
