# Speed of posting. Twitter's POST API for status updates limits us
# to 2400 per day. So 100 per hour, 25 per 15 minute period. The API
# measures in 15 minute blocks, so you can either hit the maximum of 25
# tweets as fast as you can send them, then sleep for 15 minutes, or you
# Can rate limit to 36.001 seconds and post constantly. The latter is
# preferable for posting large amounts of text
